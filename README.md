## Planning and Workflow

- We built this full stack application with React frontend and Node-Express-Mongoose backend.
- After coming up the project idea, we set up two repositories (one for frontend, and one for backend).
- We used Jira Software to create the ticket system. And we tried to mock the industry workflow.
- We created multiple tickets/issues based on our user stories and each team member went to the board for assignment.

- We used the ticket/issues number as our branch name.
- Once we completed the tasks, we push to the dev branch in repositories.
- We set a merge rull which is at least one other member need to review and approve the merge.
- After merge, we pull or rebase for the updates.
